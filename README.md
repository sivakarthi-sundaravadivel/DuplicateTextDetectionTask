Duplicate Text Detection
This project is an Android application for detecting duplicate text. The application is developed using Kotlin and XML in Android Studio.

Features
Text Processing: Converts input text to lowercase, splits by non-word characters, and filters out empty strings.
Duplicate Detection: Compares two texts by tokenizing them and calculating the similarity ratio. Determines if the texts are duplicates based on a specified similarity threshold.
